Speak, translate, return new phrase

This hack uses Google's language translation service.  Py-GoogleTrans is a Python library that translates the text you want to change using Google Translate, for this you will need to be connected the the Internet.

Speak into the microphone, the program converts your phrase into a text string which is then used in the translation, returning the new translated phrase.
